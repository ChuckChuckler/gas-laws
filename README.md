# What
## What is this?
This is a website I made to practice gas laws (PV=NRT) back when I had my chem finals.\n
I made this for myself mostly, so it's really just a terminal application that I ran in vscode directly. I don't have a UI for it (yet!) but I'm planning to add it for my friends taking AP chem.

# Why
## Why did I make it?
I made it because I needed to practice chem! I've made various other chem games in the past (many of which I submitted to High Seas!)\n

# How
## How I made it
It's honestly just a LOT of javascript. Really. That's it. A LOT of javascript and a LOT of math. Mostly functions/classes.

# What I struggled with
Math. Honestly, the product yield for the PV=NRT equation is still not correct sometimes, and I really have to go back, but my code is so dense that I genuinely cannot pinpoint where the issue is. So I guess my biggest struggle is really debugging with this one.
